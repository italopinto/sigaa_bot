#  SIGAA_BOT
### An automated way to interact with my college's site.
## Problem
It's so terrible the way that we are suposed to interact with the college site. We have to click im various things just to open the homepage.
## Solution
A bot to be used as a cli application, just to open and interact with the site with commands in the terminal.

## Requirements
- Make sure to download and unpack the latest version of geckodriver in its repository. You can also use the [get-gecko-driver python package](https://pypi.org/project/get-gecko-driver/) or my other project a bash script [geckodriver_downloader](https://github.com/italopinto/geckodriver_downloader) to automate the download, the unpack and move the driver to a folder in path, this only works on linux OS.
### TODO:
- [X] Make the bot work locally.
- [X] Make unit tests.
- [ ] Use `click` package to parse the aguments.
- [ ] Organize all the file's project.
